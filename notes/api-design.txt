RESTful API Design Best Practices

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing web services. RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.

HTTP Methods

GET is used to retrieve data without side effects. POST creates new resources or triggers actions. PUT updates entire resources. PATCH performs partial updates. DELETE removes resources.

API Design Principles

Resource-based URLs use nouns, not verbs. For example, /users/123 is better than /getUser?id=123. Resources should be hierarchical and intuitive.

Stateless design means each request should contain all information needed to process it. The server shouldn't rely on stored context between requests.

Consistent Response Format means using consistent JSON structures. Include status codes, error messages, and data in predictable formats.

Versioning involves including API version in the URL path (e.g., /v1/users) or headers to allow evolution without breaking clients.

Error Handling

Return appropriate HTTP status codes. 200 indicates success, 201 indicates created, 400 indicates bad request, 404 indicates not found, and 500 indicates server error.

Include descriptive error messages that help developers understand and fix issues. Provide both human-readable messages and machine-readable error codes.

Documentation

Good API documentation is essential. Use tools like OpenAPI/Swagger to generate interactive documentation. Include examples, parameter descriptions, and response schemas. Clear documentation reduces integration time and support requests.
